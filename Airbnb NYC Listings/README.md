# 🏠 Airbnb NYC Analysis

## Overview
This project dives into Airbnb listings in New York City to uncover trends in pricing, availability, and neighborhood dynamics. Using a real dataset of thousands of properties, I cleaned and organized the data, then built pivot tables and charts in **Google Sheets** to make sense of it all.  

The goal was to answer practical questions that could help hosts, travelers, and stakeholders better understand the NYC Airbnb market.  

### 🔑 Key Questions
- Which neighborhoods have the highest and lowest average prices?  
- What property types (entire home, private room, shared room) are most common in each borough?  
- Are there trends in availability throughout the year?  
- Where can travelers find the best value for their budget?  

### 📊 Insights at a Glance
🗺 The top 10 NYC neighborhoods with the most Airbnb reviews over the past 12 months are concentrated in Manhattan—making them high-potential zones for investment and targeted marketing.

🏘 1-bedroom listings dominate in 9 of these neighborhoods, while studios are most popular in Midtown.

💰 In Midtown, studios not only lead in popularity but also generated the highest revenue. Similar trends were seen in Hell’s Kitchen (2-bedroom), East Harlem (studios), and Chelsea (2-bedroom), where less common property types outperformed others in revenue.

📌 These findings highlight that popularity doesn’t always align with revenue, offering strategic opportunities for hosts and investors.
