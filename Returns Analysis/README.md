# 🔄 Returns Analysis (Tableau)

## Overview
This project explores product return data to uncover patterns and trends that can help reduce return rates and improve operational efficiency. Using Tableau, I built an interactive dashboard that breaks down return rates by category, region, and time period.  

The goal was to give stakeholders a clear view of return hotspots and support data-driven decisions in inventory management, supply chain, and customer satisfaction strategies.  

### 🔑 Key Questions
- Which product categories have the highest return rates?  
- Are certain regions experiencing more returns than others?  
- What trends emerge when analyzing returns over time?  
- Where can operational adjustments reduce return volumes?  

### 📊 Insights at a Glance
- 📦 Identified high-return product categories, helping prioritize quality control and customer support efforts.  
- 🗺 Mapped regions with the highest return rates to inform supply chain improvements.  
- 📅 Detected seasonal spikes in returns, supporting proactive planning and staffing.  
- 📌 Highlighted opportunities for process improvements to reduce overall return volumes.  

### 🛠 Tools Used
- Tableau: Interactive dashboards, calculated fields, and visual storytelling  
- Excel: Data cleaning and preparation
